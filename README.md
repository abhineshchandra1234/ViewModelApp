# ViewModel in kotlin

This project explains with a simple example of how to implement the view model in kotlin

- ViewModel handles all the data for the UI
- it is created when an activity is created. It survives configuration changes.
- when using ViewModel and suppose configuration changes or you switch apps, old data will remain
  saved in ViewModel
- It is destroyed only when activity is destroyed or when you press the back button and the application
  is closed and activity is destroyed.
