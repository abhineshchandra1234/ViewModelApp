# ViewModel in kotlin

This project explain with a simple example on how to implement view model in kotlin

- ViewModel handles all the data for the ui
- it is created when activity is created. It survives configuration changes.
- when using ViewModel and suppose configuration changes or you switch app, old data will remain
  saved in ViewModel
- It is destroyed only when activity is destroyed or when you press the back button and application
  is closed and activity is destroyed.
